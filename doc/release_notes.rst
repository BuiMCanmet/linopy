Release Notes
=============

Upcoming Release
----------------

* The "_term" dimension in the ``LinearExpression`` class is now stored without coordinates.
* As soon as a linear expression is added to a model the "_term" dimension is rename to "{constraintname}_term" in order align the model better with the contained arrays and to avoid unnecessary nans.
* ``LinearExpression`` now allows empty data as input.
* ``add_variables`` and ``add_constraints`` now accept a new argument ``mask``. The mask, which should be an boolean array, defines whether a variable/constraint is active (True) or should be ignored (False).
* Missing values in the ``Model.variables`` and ``Model.constraints`` arrays are now indicated by -1. This circumvents changing the type from `int` to `float`.
* A set of experimental eval functions was added. Now one can assign variable and constraints using string expressions. For further information see `linopy.Model.vareval`, `linopy.Model.lineval` and `linopy.Model.coneval`.
* ``Model`` has a new argument `force_dim_names`. When set to true assigned variables, constraints and data must always have custom dimension names, otherwise a ValueError is raised. These helps to avoid unintended broadcasting over dimension. Especially the use of pandas DataFrames and Series may become safer.
